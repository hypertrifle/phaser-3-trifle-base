# V 1.0.2

- massive overhaul to the scale controller that can be configured from within the settings file, currently it doesn't do any aligning but flexbox with solve that if required.
- made agnostic to the technology it sits in, it will not create both its own content container as well as any overlay divs it requires.
- updated any game models to reflect this
